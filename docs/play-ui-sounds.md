There may be a UI Sounds service implemented inside the context in which you use Kano Code.

That service should recieve an id of a sound to play. The sounds played from within Kano Code have generic ids to allow the context to assign what sound should play on request.

The currently used ids are:
* win
* start-challenge
* banner-change
* pop
* click
* toggle-open
* toggle-close
* add
* beacon
